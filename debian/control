Description: Wilcard File Name matching library 
 Wildcard Match provides an enhanced fnmatch, glob, and pathlib library
 in order to provide file matching and globbing that more closely follows
 the features found in Bash. In some ways these libraries are similar to
 Python's builtin libraries as they provide a similar interface to match,
 filter, and glob the file system. But they also include a number of
 features found in Bash's globbing such as backslash escaping, brace
 expansion, extended glob pattern groups, etc. They also add a number of
 new useful functions as well, such as globmatch which functions like
 fnmatch, but for paths.
